# shitty-mlcc-xy-stage

This experiment aims to develop a mechanical super resolution stage for the OpenIRV project. The idea is to move the 60Hz 320x240px thermal imaging camera into four different positions during the recording to get a 15Hz 640*480px image. This would of course be ideal, but the image acquisition is not done every 16.6ms for an infinitely short time, but continuously, so the image will be "blurred". To cover the pixel-pitch of 17µm, the stage has to move about +-9µm in x- and y-direction.

This stage has also never been tested, I'm a sometimes lazy catgirl, meow!
